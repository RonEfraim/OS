 * Program:    Sort With Threads
 * ============================================================================
 * This program creates 5 processes.
 * each process will allocate an array with 10 cells and insert random values in
 * range of 1-1000 and will sort the array with bubble sort and make it global
 * with pthread_setspecific() function.
 * the main process will get all of the 5 sorted arrays and will merge them
 * into 1 sorted array and will print it.
 *
 * Compile: gcc -pthread -o ex8a ex8a.c
 * Run: ex8a
 * Input: none
 * Output: all of the numbers rolled sorted

 * Program:    Find Vals In Matrix
 * ============================================================================
 * This program fills matrix in random values and creates 4 threads.
 * each process will run in infinite loop and will roll random value in the
 * range of 1-1000. the process will look for the value he rolled in the
 * fathers matrix and when he finds he will put 0 instead of the value. if all
 * the row will be filled with 0's the process will print it's number and will
 * kill all the other processes.
 *
 * Compile: gcc -pthread -o ex8b ex8b.c
 * Run: ex8b
 * Input: none
 * Output: the number of the process that found all the values in his row first
