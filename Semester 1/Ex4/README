 * Program:    GCD and Primes servers
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This program has 2 serever- one that calculates the GCD of 2 numbers and the
 * other that breaks a number to its primes (up to 100).
 * the client get data through the argument vector, if 0 is entered then the 
 * GCD server is activated and 2 numbers need to be entered after the 0 and if
 * 1 was enterd the the primes server is activated and 1 number needs to be 
 * entered after 1. 
 * the result will be send back through a message queue and client will print
 * it.
 * the run will end by getting SIGINT.

 * Compile: gcc -Wall ex4a.c -0 ex4a
 * Run: ex4a
 * Input: 0 or 1, if 0- 2 ints after, if 1- one int after
 * Output: if 1- all its primes, if 0- the gcd of 2 num entered.

 * Program:    Father To Child Message Queue
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This program opens a msg q and make 2 children. each child defnes array with
 * 10 cells and fill it with random ints. the dad rolls ints from 0 to 100 in
 * an endless loop and and send to each child, once a child got all the ints
 * from dad and marked them all in his array it kills the other child and send
 * the dad a message and prints the numbers.
 *
 * Compile: gcc -Wall ex4c.c -0 ex4c
 * Run: ex4c
 * Input: none
 * Output: the array of the child that finished first
